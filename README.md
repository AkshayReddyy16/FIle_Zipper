# File Zipper Project - Huffman Coding

## Overview

The File Zipper project implements file compression and decompression using Huffman coding. Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm that assigns variable-length codes to input characters, with shorter codes assigned to more frequent characters. This project aims to reduce the size of files, saving storage space and transmission time.

## Features

- **Compression**: Compresses files using Huffman coding, resulting in reduced file sizes.
- **Decompression**: Decompresses Huffman-coded files back to their original form.
- **Custom Encoding**: Generates and uses a custom Huffman tree based on the frequency of characters in the input file.
- **File Handling**: Supports various file types for compression and decompression.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
- Standard C++ library
